# Chat SDK for NLX bots

The official JavaScript SDK to communicate with conversational bots created using NLX Dialog Studio. It contains the following packages:
* [@nlxchat/widget](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nlxchat/widget): the official out-of-the-box, lightly themeable NLX widget.
* [@nlxchat/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nlxchat/core): vanilla JavaScript SDK for creating fully custom chat widgets.
* [@nlxchat/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nlxchat/react): React custom hook for building chat widgets.
* [@nlxchat/preact](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nlxchat/preact): Preact custom hook for building chat widgets.

## Usage with \*

Do you work with Vue? React without hooks? Custom elements? Let us know what framework you are looking to build web-based chat applications with so we can look into making utilities for those.

> *ps* if you work with Svelte, the conversation object returned by the core SDK satisfies [the Svelte store contract](https://svelte.dev/docs#component-format-script-4-prefix-stores-with-$-to-access-their-values-store-contract).

## TypeScript

All SDK packages are written in TypeScript so you can use our type definitions in your project.
